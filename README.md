This code implements a system for classifying images of three celebrities and predicting the identity of a person in a new input image using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The process involves creating a dataset, training a CNN model, and using it for prediction.

1. Dataset Creation:
The dataset is organized into directories for training and testing, each containing subdirectories for the three chosen celebrities: Kane Williamson, Maria Sharapova, and Ronaldo.
Each subdirectory contains at least 100 images of the respective celebrity. The images are read, resized to a uniform size of 150x150 pixels with 3 color channels, and stored in numpy arrays (X_train and X_test).
Corresponding labels (y_train and y_test) are assigned as integers representing the categories.
2. Model Building:
A CNN is designed using Keras with the following architecture:
A convolutional layer with 32 filters and a ReLU activation function to extract image features.
A max-pooling layer to reduce the spatial dimensions.
A flattening layer to prepare data for fully connected layers.
Dense layers, including the final layer with a softmax activation function, to classify images into one of the three categories.
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, suitable for multi-class classification.
3. Training and Evaluation:
The CNN is trained on the training dataset for 20 epochs with a batch size of 12.
After training, the model is evaluated on the testing dataset to assess its accuracy and performance.
4. Prediction and Profile Generation:
For a new input image (e.g., cristiano.jpg), the model predicts the celebrity category by reshaping the image to match the input dimensions and passing it through the trained model.
The predicted class index is used to retrieve the corresponding celebrity's name from the categories list.
A profile for the detected person can be generated by associating additional details (e.g., biography, achievements) for the predicted celebrity.
